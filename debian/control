        keyboard, and even remotely from your phone.
    - Send links via KDE Connect
        Adds a context menu entry to links enabling you to send them to your phone and other paired devices.
    - Show downloads in and control them from Plasmaâ€™s notification area.

        Make sure the "Browser Tabs" module is enabled in Plasma Search (KRunner) settings.
